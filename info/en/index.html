<!-- TODO: WATER TAP + Grill/fireplace(?) -->

<p>We're happy you're reading this, it means you have checked in :-)</p>
<p>Here you will find various practical information.<br/>
(Click on the headlines to see more, or <a href="#se-alt" onclick="return showAll();">show everything at once</a>.)</p>

<h2 class="section-title" id="header-outdoorsarea" onclick="return toggleSection('outdoorsarea', this);">
    Outdoor Area
    <object data="/g/expand_all.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
</h2>
<section id="outdoorsarea">
    <p>All outdoor furniture except black sun loungers are inside when you arrive.</p>
    <p>You are free to bring out the outdoor furnitures you want, they can stay outside throughout your stay.</p>
    <p>Of course, they can also be brought back in :-) if they are completely dry.</p>
    <p>Cushions are always brought in at night to avoid condensation, or if it starts to rain.
        In case of rain, the table with a wooden surface should also be brought inside, thank you!</p>

    <p>The net outside the deck by the jacuzzi is for relaxing in, preferably with blankets and pillows if you want.
        It is intended for children, max 70 kg in the net at a time and <u>no</u> jumping!! =)</p>
    <p><b>The slope</b> covered with black plastic should not be stepped on, as the plastic can come loose.<br/>
        If a football or anything else rolls down the slope: You have to walk outside the plastic (on any side you prefer).<br/>
        (This happens quite often with us, having a 6 year old who likes to play ball.)</p>
    <p>Fireplace: located behind the cabin, inside tarpaulin under the air conditioner.
        Use wood, charcoal, briquettes, whatever you want. We usually mix wood, lighter fluid, and briquettes.<br/>
        The grill grate is in the cushion box, next to the outside water outlet.<br/>
        Clean the grate afterward.<br/>
        It can be difficult to get the grate back into the box, it can alternatively just be placed together with / on top of the grill.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Water hose: There are 2 outlets, Vault 1 and 2 (right / left), use no. 1, the gray hose.
        To start the water: Press the button to select "Vault 1", then press the "Man" button. Press "Man" again to stop.
        Or: contact us.</p>

    Inside the Cabin

</h2>
<section id="indoors">
<ol>
    <li>The kitchen lacks a "splash wall" behind the sink and stovetop,
        so we currently have a loose glass plate by the stovetop and are generally careful to wipe off
        any splashes that occur, <b>thank you</b> for doing the same :-)</li>
    <li>The living room window and bedroom window facing the road are typically open on a summer night,
        but avoid this if rain is expected, as the rain can come inside.</li>
    <li>Bedroom 1: Before bedtime, it can be a good idea to open the window and close the door to the room,
        so that the summer heat from the cabin does not warm up the room, which will cool down a bit in the meantime.</li>
    <li>Our boy usually sleeps in Bedroom 1 and has on the hottest days benefited from the portable fan
        (on the shelf in Bedroom 2) which can be plugged into the power inside the technical cabinet on the wall.</li>
    <li>It is also possible to sleep at the loft, closest to the window there is naturally the most circulation.<br/>
        Take bedding from another bed.<br/>
        If, for example, the two people staying in Bedroom 1 each want their own bed / room and one person moves to the loft,
        then the bed in Bedroom 1 can be converted into a single bed.
        Simply stack all the mattresses on top of each other, push in the drawers and pretend you are in the fairy tale "the prince(ss) and the pea" :-)<br>
        If this is done, the bed can just stay like that when you leave the cabin.
    </li>
    <li>User manual for the air conditioner <a href="/assets/manual-toshiba-signatur25.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>
        Typical use is to set "Mode" to "A" for automatic cooling/heating based on the selected temperature,
        and "Fan" to either "Auto" or desired strength, here "Quiet" (the face showing "Shush") can be a good night mode.<br/>
        (We usually turn it off at night.)

    Using the Jacuzzi

</h2>
<section id="jacuzzi">
    <ul>
        <li>It is crucial to the water quality for you all to <strong>shower</strong> before entering the jacuzzi.<br/>
            Even if you "feel" clean, there are always loose skin particles and residues on the skin that are not good for the water and filters.</li>
            <ul><li>Hair, sweat, makeup, soap residue, sunscreen, etc. are bad for the water and filters.</li></ul>+
            <ul><li>We know, it's tempting to skip it, please don't :-)</li></ul>
        </li>

        <li>Bring a cloth. Upon arrival + occasionally, we usually bring a cloth (not the kitchen cloth),
            there should be one together with the other jacuzzi items, to wipe along the waterline where things typically settle.<br/>
            Then the filters should catch until next time.<br/><br/>
       </li>

       <li>Rinse / wash your feet before getting in.</li>
        
        <li>The cover, we usually place standing at an angle on the side either from where the wind blows or as a privacy shield,
            most often it stands as in the picture.
            <br/>
            <img src="/g/jacuzzilokk-nabo.png" width="200" alt="Jacuzzi with the cover standing, slightly leaning against the jacuzzi, on the side facing the neighbor." />
        </li>
        <li>If you need to adjust the temperature, do so by pressing the "Tmp" button.<br/>
            The first press shows the current setting.<br/>
            Each new press changes the temperature by 0.5 degrees.<br/>
            Press the "Light" button to "save" the temperature (or do nothing, the selected temperature will also be saved).<br/>
            <ul><li>Each time you have saved and press "Tmp" again (after it stops blinking), it switches between increasing or decreasing the temperature.</li></ul>
            <br/>
        </li>
        <li>Put the cover on between each use.</li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Small flies etc. also like to bathe.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Inside</strong>: Keep the wooden floor dry after bathing/showering, if you walk through the cabin wet, find old towels in the bathroom drawer which can be placed/used on the floor.
            The point is to avoid leaving water that will stain the wooden floor.
            <br/><br/>
        </li>
        
        <li><b>There is chlorine in the water.</b> Perfect water is not always easy, many factors are involved, the short version based on experience is:
            <li>When you are done:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add 1 teaspoon of dissolved chlorine to the water. (Use the liter measure.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>After about 3-4 baths (typically every other day +):
                <ul>
                    <li>Add 1 small teaspoon of "pH-plus" powder directly to the water.</li>
                </ul>
                P.S. Chlorine dissipates over (a short) time, so a little too much is ok, while the pH-level does not decrease by itself.
                You can either measure or feel the pH; if it gets a bit high, the water can feel soapy and
                the bubbles do not burst as easy and you will get a kind of foam bath (it is not dangerous).<br/>
                (and the body waste from those bathing settles on the bubbles and the pool edge instead of in the filter =) )<br/>
                If you are unsure or think it is a bit too much, use a pH strip and test the water.
            </li>
            <li>Every other day (provided you have bathed both days):
                <ul>
                    <li>Also add 1 small teaspoon of "Clear pool" directly to the water. (This prevents biofilm in the bath.)</li>
                </ul>
                That's it, done.<br/><br/>
    
                There is still a bit more to know :-)
            </li>       
            <li>The chlorine should be dissolved before it is poured into the water,
                we use the liter-measure that is together with the jacuzzi items (at the bottom of the gray shelf by the entrance door).</li>
            <li>Start with water in the liter measure, preferably take water directly from the jacuzzi,
                then add the powder, stir until most of it is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Then pour the chlorine water around the edge of the bath or near the intake of the filters (when the pump is running).</li>
            <li>If the water quality is visibly reduced, use instead: 2 teaspoons of chlorine.<br/>
                + consider 1 teaspoon of “Clear pool” (added directly to the bath, not in the chlorine solution).
            </li>
            <li>Let all three bubbles run for 8 minutes, preferably with the lid partially on.<br/>
                (I personally place the lid completely over but let it rest on the liter measure so that plenty of air comes in/out)
                <br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>P.S. There are also "pH strips" to check the pH value which should be around 7.0.<br/>
                <!-- (The pH value is important for the chlorine to work optimally and to avoid skin irritation).<br/> -->
                We have never needed to lower the pH value, only raise it, which is why only the "ph-plus" version is available.<br/>
                If you want to adjust the pH value, it takes a little time in the sense that the water needs to be well mixed and it is important not to add too much "plus" at once.
                The pH-scale is not linear and you can quickly add too much.<br/>
                1 teaspoon or a little less is what we usually use, do not use more than that at a time,
                it can be added directly to the pool as powder or dissolved,
                then the water needs to be well mixed before measuring again.<br/>
                Tip: The first day at the cabin when a bath is done: Measure the pH, if it is below 7.0, add 1 teaspoon of "plus" (directly in the bath) + chlorine (dissolved) as mentioned above, then it will be well mixed by the next morning.
