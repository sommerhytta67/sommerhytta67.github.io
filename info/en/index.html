    Outdoor Area
    <object data="/g/expand_all.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
</h2>
<section id="outdoorsarea">
    <p>All outdoor furniture except black sun loungers are inside when you arrive.</p>
    <p>You are free to bring out the outdoor furnitures you want, they can stay outside throughout your stay.</p>
    <p>Of course, they can also be brought back in :-) if they are completely dry.</p>
    <p>Cushions are always brought in at night to avoid condensation, or if it starts to rain.
        In case of rain, the table with a wooden surface should also be brought inside, thank you!</p>

    <p>The net outside the deck by the jacuzzi is for relaxing in, preferably with blankets and pillows if you want.
        It is intended for children, max 70 kg in the net at a time and <u>no</u> jumping!! =)</p>
    <p><b>The slope</b> covered with black plastic should not be stepped on, as the plastic can come loose.<br/>
        If a football or anything else rolls down the slope: You have to walk outside the plastic (on any side you prefer).<br/>
        (This happens quite often with us, having a 6 year old who likes to play ball.)</p>
    <p>Fireplace: located behind the cabin, inside tarpaulin under the air conditioner.
        Use wood, charcoal, briquettes, whatever you want. We usually mix wood, lighter fluid, and briquettes.<br/>
        The grill grate is in the cushion box, next to the outside water outlet.<br/>
        Clean the grate afterward.<br/>
        It can be difficult to get the grate back into the box, it can alternatively just be placed together with / on top of the grill.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Water hose: There are 2 outlets, Vault 1 and 2 (right / left), use no. 1, the gray hose.
        To start the water: Press the button to select "Vault 1", then press the "Man" button. Press "Man" again to stop.
        Or: contact us.</p>

<section id="indoors">
<ol>
    <li>The kitchen lacks a "splash wall" behind the sink and stovetop,
        so we currently have a loose glass plate by the stovetop and are generally careful to wipe off
        any splashes that occur, <b>thank you</b> for doing the same :-)</li>
    <li>The living room window and bedroom window facing the road are typically open on a summer night,
        but avoid this if rain is expected, as the rain can come inside.</li>
    <!-- <li>Bedroom 1: Before bedtime, it can be a good idea to open the window and close the door to the room,
        so that the summer heat from the cabin does not warm up the room, which will cool down a bit in the meantime.</li>
    <li>Our boy usually sleeps in Bedroom 1 and has on the hottest days benefited from the portable fan
        (on the shelf in Bedroom 2) which can be plugged into the power inside the technical cabinet on the wall.</li> -->
    <li>It is also possible to sleep at the loft, closest to the window there is naturally the most circulation.<br/>
        Take bedding from another bed.<br/>
        If, for example, the two people staying in Bedroom 1 each want their own bed / room and one person moves to the loft,
        then the bed in Bedroom 1 can be converted into a single bed.
        Simply stack all the mattresses on top of each other,
        push in the drawers and pretend you are in the fairy tale "the prince(ss) and the pea" :-)<br>
        If this is done, the bed can just stay that way when you leave the cabin.
    </li>
    <li>User manual for the air conditioner <a href="/assets/manual-toshiba-signatur25.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>
        Typical use is to set "Mode" to "A" for automatic cooling/heating based on the selected temperature,
        and "Fan" to either "Auto" or desired strength, here "Quiet" (the face showing "Shush") can be a good night mode.<br/>
        (We usually turn it off at night.)

        <li>Since it varies how close to your check-in we attended to the pool,
            the chlorine in the water should be checked before use.
            See the point down below "<a href="#clorine">There is chlorine in the water</a>".
        </li>
        <li>It is essential for the water quality to <strong>shower</strong> before you bathe.
            <ul>
                <li>Hair, sweat, makeup, soap residue, sunscreen, loose skin particles, etc., are bad for the water and filters.</li>
                <li>Thanks :-)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    
        <li>Bring a cloth. At first bath + occasionally, we usually bring a cloth (not the kitchen cloth),
            to wipe along the waterline where things typically accumulate.<br/>
            There should be one together with the jacuzzi items.
            The filters will take care of it by the next time.<br/><br/>
        </li>
    
        <li>Rinse/wash your feet before getting into the water.</li>
    
        <li>The lid, we usually set it standing at an angle on the side where the wind comes from, or to block any view,
            most often it stands as shown in the picture.

        </li>
        <li>If you need to adjust the temperature, do so by pressing the "Tmp" button.<br/>
            The first press shows the current setting.<br/>
            Each new press will change the temperature by 0.5 degrees.<br/>
            Select the "Light" button to "save" the temperature (or do nothing, the selected temperature will also be saved).<br/>
            <ul><li>Each time you save and press "Tmp" again (after it stops blinking), it will switch between increasing or decreasing the temperature.</li></ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Put the lid on between each use.</li>
                <li>Depending on the wind, etc., there might quickly be some small debris (and flies); use the pool net to remove what you can.<br/>
                    You can find the net on the bottom shelf in the bedroom and the handle behind it, as shown in the picture.<br/>

        <li><strong>Indoors</strong>: Avoid wet parquet after showering and bathing,
            if you walk through the cabin while wet, old towels stored in the bathroom drawer can be laid/used on the floor,
            just avoid leaving water that creates marks on the wooden floor.

        <li><b><a name="clorine" class="text">There is chlorine in the water.</a></b>
            Perfect water isn't always so simple, there are many factors.<br/>
            During your stay, perhaps only chlorine and 'Seaklear' need to be added.<br/>
            The short version:
            <ol>
                <li>Check that there is chlorine in the floater. (see how in the list below)</li>
                <li>If the water smells and looks good, take a bath.</li>
                <li>After the bath, remove debris from the surface with the net (see where it is in the picture above)</li>
                <li>With 'normal' use, the chlorine tablet in the floater is usually enough, and you won't need to add more for the next two days.</li>
                <li>pH doesn't change much and likely doesn't need adjusting before check-out.</li>
                <li>Every fourth day or before you check out, add 'Seaklear' (see how below).</li>
            </ol>
            The long version:
            <ol>
                <li>Check that there is a chlorine tablet in the "floater".<br/>
                    (1 tablet usually lasts 2-3 days, depending on usage.)<br/><br/>
                    Slowly lift and remove the cover as shown in the picture.<br/>
                    <img width="200" src="/g/pool-filter-grid-opening.png" alt="Jacuzzi filter cover, halfway open." />
                    <br/>
                    <b>Note:</b> The floater has a small (blue) opening at the bottom, it should not be adjusted.<br/>
                    Remove and open the floater by unscrewing the large blue lid, press down and twist.<br/>
                </li>
                <li>If it's empty or the one there is almost used up, add 1 new tablet, see pictures:<br/>

                <li>
                    Put the lid back on.<br/>
                    Place the floater back behind the cover.<br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slowly slide the cover back into place.

        <li>
            It may be wise to check the chlorine level in the water, it should be between 1.5 to 2.5+<br/>
            We have both test strips and a testing device.<br/>
            <li>Strips, have these instructions on the back of the box:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hold the strip under water for 2 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Wait 15 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Compare the color to the color chart on the box.</li>
                    <li>Both chlorine and pH levels are read simultaneously here.</li>
                    <li><img width="200" src="/g/pool-test-strip.png" alt="Pool test strip on top of its box." /></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Testing device, do the following:<br/>
                Chlorine level:
                <ol>
                    <li>Without using force, check that the wheel is turned all the way to the right.</li>
                    <li>Then slowly turn the wheel to the left until the needle points to the letter "C", as shown in the picture.
                        <img width="200" src="/g/pool-clorine-testing-device.png" alt="Pool tester device, adjusted so the needle points to 'C'" />
                    </li>
                    <li>Do not measure directly in the pool if the water is circulating, as this will give a false reading.</li>
                    <li>Take water from the pool in a measuring cup and measure there.</li>
                    <li>When the needle points to C, place the measuring rods in the water, all the way up to the black plastic.</li>
                    <li>Wait for the needle to adjust, it may take a few seconds.</li>
                    <li>Anything from 1.5 to 2.5 is good.</li>
                    <li>When you're done, turn the wheel to the right again, the device is "off" when the wheel is turned all the way to the right and the needle is all the way to the right.</li>
                </ol>
                pH level: (should be between 7.0 and 7.4)
                <ol>
                    <li>Turn the wheel all the way to the right and then even more to the right until it clicks, then the needle will pop up and be ready for measurement.</li>
                    <li>Do as with the chlorine measurement, take water in the measuring cup and measure there.</li>
                    <li>When you're done, turn the wheel to the right again, out of "pH mode", the device is "off" when the wheel is turned to the right in "chlorine mode" / when the needle is all the way to the right.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Chlorine: Too little or too much?
                <ul>
                    <li>Too little, and there is still a tablet in the floater?
                        Have you just bathed for a long time with lots of bubbles? Then I would wait an hour and measure again.
                        If it is still too low, add more chlorine in the form of powder/granulate that is dissolved in a measuring cup of water before pouring it into the pool.<br/>
                        <img width="200" src="/g/pool-chemistry-clorine.png" alt="Chlorine powder to be mixed in a measuring cup." />
                        <br/>
                        Use 5ml of chlorine at a time, water in the measuring cup first, stir until almost everything is dissolved.<br />
                        Pour into the pool, preferably right in front of the intake to the filters, and let the bubbles run for 10+ minutes before measuring again.
                    </li>
                    <li>If it's too much, please let me know so I might understand why.<br/>
                        This is probably nothing to worry about, but if it does happen:<br/>
                        Remove the floater (with chlorine), remove the jacuzzi lid, and start the bubbles.<br/>
                        Chlorine dissipates over time and faster when exposed to air.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                pH level: Too high or too low?<br/>
                You probably won't experience the pH level being too high since pH decreases with use.<br/>
                If the pH is too low, add "pH-plus", which is a white powder that dissolves in water.<br/>
                Use 5ml of pH-plus at a time, water in the measuring cup first, stir, it dissolves quickly.<br/>
                Pour into the pool, preferably right in front of the intake to the filters. Start the bubbles and wait about 20 minutes before measuring again.<br/>
                Repeat the process until you're satisfied.
